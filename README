Finance-OFX version 0.01
========================

The Finance::OFX module is an implementation of an Open Financial Exchange 
client. At the moment it can be used to query account information and 
transaction statements from financial institutions supporting OFX version 1. 
Eventually it should be able to handle all OFX v1 and v2 operations, as well 
as load saved files (in case you're like me and have several years worth of 
manually downloaded ofx files).
